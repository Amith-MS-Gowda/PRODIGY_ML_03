Description
This Python script implements a simple image classification model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to distinguish between cat and dog images. The script loads images from a specified directory, preprocesses them, trains an SVM model, and evaluates its performance using accuracy and other metrics.
Key Features
Data Loading:
Loads images from specified folders for cats and dogs.
Resizes images to a uniform dimension of 64x64 pixels for consistency.
Labeling:
Assigns labels to images: 0 for cats and 1 for dogs.
Image Preprocessing:
Reshapes images into 1D arrays, which is required by the SVM.
Normalizes pixel values to the range [0, 1] to enhance model training.
Data Splitting:
Divides the dataset into training and testing subsets (80% training, 20% testing) using train_test_split.
Model Training:
Trains a linear kernel SVM model on the training data with a regularization parameter C set to 1.
Model Prediction:
Makes predictions on the test set using the trained SVM model.
Model Evaluation:
Calculates and prints the accuracy of the model.
Displays a classification report detailing precision, recall, and F1-score.
Outputs the confusion matrix to visualize classification performance.
Use Cases
This script can be utilized in applications involving animal image classification, enabling automated systems to distinguish between different animal species based on their images. It serves as a foundational model that can be expanded upon for more complex image classification tasks or integrated into larger machine learning projects
